# Introduction {#Introduction}
This is an introduction to reproducibility in R.

## Starting with RStudio
Information about RStudio
Opening R Studio

You can add **bold text** or __bold text__
You can add *italic text* or _italic text with underscores_

Adding superscript ^is^ not so easy
Adding subscript using ~tilde~

If you add inline code use the backtick `to write code`

We have covered this in the [Introduction section](#Introduction).
You can also create [links to Google](https://www.google.com) for example.
But you might have some link to the footnote [^1].

[^1]: This is my first footnote.

## Lists
Ordered lists take numbers

1. Item A
2. Item B
3. Item C
    a. Sublist 1 #indented with 4 spaces
    b. Sublist 2
    
You also have unordered lists:

 - Item A
 - Item B
 
 Tasks - if uploaded to github will create tickboxes (doesn't show up in html)
 - [ ]
 - [x]
 
 Linking an image
 
 ![My image is a cow](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/13/11/tariffs-4.jpg?w968)
 Can also copy local image location
 
## Tables
 
 You can create tables using | -
 
 | Column header | Another column |
 | ------------- | -------------- |
 | First row     | With info      |
 | More rows     | With more info |
 
 
 > A greater than sign creates blocks
 
 How does that look?
 How would we highlight code?
 
 Single `backticks` are used inline to highlight 
 
 To write a block of code start with three backticks (this does not get executed):
 
 ```
 print("hello")
 read.csv("data.txt")
 ```
 
 Can also do this by Code > Insert Chunk or by Ctrl-Alt-I (this does get executed):
```{r}
 print("hello")
75 * 8
```
